## Project Structure

```

## Technical Design

### State Management

The game uses React's useState hook with a comprehensive GameState type that includes:

- Deck of cards
- Player and dealer hands
- Game status
- Scores
- Betting information
- Split/Double capabilities
- Statistics

### Data Persistence

- Player money and statistics are stored in localStorage
- Automatically saves after each hand
- Persists across browser sessions

### Card Handling

- Cards are represented as objects with suit, rank, and value
- Aces are handled dynamically (1 or 11)
- Hidden dealer card is tracked with a hidden flag

### Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Use early returns for cleaner code
- Maintain type safety
- Use TailwindCSS for styling
- Keep components focused and single-purpose

### Areas for Improvement

- Add unit tests
- Implement card animations
- Add sound effects
- Support multiple players
- Add additional betting options
- Implement a proper deck shoe
- Add card counting statistics

## Component API

### BlackjackGame

Main game component that handles all game logic and rendering.

#### State

```typescript
type GameState = {
  deck: Card[];
  playerHands: Card[][];
  activeHandIndex: number;
  dealerHand: Card[];
  gameStatus: GameStatus;
  playerScores: number[];
  dealerScore: number;
  currentBet: number;
  playerMoney: number;
  canSplit: boolean;
  canDouble: boolean;
  stats: {
    wins: number;
    losses: number;
    pushes: number;
  };
};
```

#### Key Methods

- `handleStartGame()`: Initiates a new hand
- `handleHit()`: Adds a card to the active hand
- `handleStand()`: Completes player turn and runs dealer logic
- `handleDouble()`: Doubles bet and takes one card
- `handleSplit()`: Splits matching cards into two hands
- `handleBetInput()`: Processes custom bet amounts
