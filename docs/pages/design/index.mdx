The available variants in the system are:

- `title`: used for page titles.
- `subtitle`: used for page subtitles.
- `h1`: used for primary section titles.
- `h2`: used for secondary section titles.
- `h3`: used for tertiary section titles.
- `body`: used for body text.

### Variants

The typography system is based on the [Radix UI Typography](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/theme/typography). So props such as `size` and `weight` can be passed to override the set variants to increase flexibility.

**Note:** Stick to the variants to maintain a clean and consistent typography system.

### Size & Weight

The playground below allows you to adjust the `size` and the `weight` of the text.
